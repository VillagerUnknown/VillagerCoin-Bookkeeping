# VillagerUnknown's Bookkeeping for Villager Coin

Adds Bookkeeping items to VillagerUnknown's Villager Coin to track financial records and transactions.

* Receipts allow players to create records of transactions by placing a piece of paper in a crafting table with stacks of coins.
* Ledgers allow players to file receipts into an organized book. Better than a shoebox, right?

## Receipts

Players can craft receipts for transactions by placing the payment amount of coins in the crafting table with paper. 
When a receipt is crafted, the date, amount, and player name will be added to the receipt. 
Receipts from the same player and date will stack and sum the totals. 
This is a fun and easy way for multiplayer servers to make transactions feel more realistic.

At the bottom of each receipt is a thank-you message. 
The default message can be set in the config but players can change the thank-you message by using a named piece of 
paper as the paper ingredient for their receipt.
