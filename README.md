# VillagerUnknown's Bookkeeping for Villager Coin

Adds Bookkeeping items to VillagerUnknown's Villager Coin to track financial records and transactions.

* Receipts allow players to create records of transactions by placing a piece of paper in a crafting table with stacks of coins.

## Receipts

Players can craft receipts for transactions by placing the payment amount of coins in the crafting table with paper. When a receipt is crafted, the date, amount, and player name will be added to the receipt. Receipts from the same player and date will stack and sum the totals. This is a fun and easy way for multiplayer servers to make transactions feel more realistic.

_Quick-crafting (shift-clicking crafted items to craft the maximum) will work as expected with receipts._

## Ledgers

* Ledgers allow players to file receipts into an organized book. Better than a shoebox, right?
